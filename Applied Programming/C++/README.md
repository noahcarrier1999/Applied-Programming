# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}
This is a portfolio that shows the work that I have done to learn C++ and the proof of the knowledge gained by making a Bank Account application

{Provide a description of your software}
This software allows the user to add accounts and keep track of the accounts by allowing them to add funds or withdraw fund to the account.

{Describe your purpose for creating this software.}
I created this software to have a simple way of keeping track of accounts and to also show that I understand C++.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
